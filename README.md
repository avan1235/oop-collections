# MultiCollections

Your goal for today is to implement your version of multiset and multimap collections in Java.
You can use standard Java collections (your code has to compile with **Java 11**) for your implementation.
You can get 2 points for this task:
1. Implementation of `IMultiset` and at least 3 **meaningful** unit tests of your implementation
2. Implementation of `IMultimap` and at least 3 **meaningful** unit tests of your implementation (notice that it uses
`IMultiset` so you cannot start with this implementation)

Remember to write your implementation in generic way and keeping your code clean.

The deadline for this task is 29.05.2022 (23:59)
